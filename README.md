# TBC x USAID Tech Education Program



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this.

This project is a website for the TBC x USAID Tech Education Program, which offers free online practical courses in various IT fields. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and follows best practices for accessibility and responsive design.



## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

index.html: the main HTML file for the website
css/: a directory containing all the CSS files for the project
style.css: the main CSS file for the website
reset.css: a CSS file that resets the default styles for all HTML elements
fonts/: a directory containing the custom font files used in the project
assetts/: a directory containing all the image and icon files used in the project
script.js: the main JavaScript file for the website


## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

HTML: used to structure the content of the website
CSS: used to style the website and make it responsive
JavaScript: used to add interactivity to the website and handle user input
SVG: used to create vector-based graphics for the website
Font Awesome: used to add icons to the website


## Running the Project

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. There is no server-side code, so the website can be run locally without any setup.

To develop the project, it is recommended to use a text editor or IDE that supports syntax highlighting and code completion for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

To test the responsiveness of the website, it is recommended to use a browser that supports responsive design tools, such as Chrome or Firefox. These tools allow you to preview the website at different screen sizes and resolutions, and debug any issues that may arise.
